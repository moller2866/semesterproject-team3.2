    This ship is working for the Ocean Cleanup Project and it's
    goal is to help clean the ocean of plastic. We aim to clean 
    up 90% of floating ocean plastic pollution.
    It is estimated that there are more then 150 million tons
    of plastic in the ocean today, and around 13.000 pieces of
    plastic per square kilometer. So we need help!
    If you want to help then you can start unloading the ship.
    You can go to the recycling center east of the dock and talk 
    to the person working there for help.""");
